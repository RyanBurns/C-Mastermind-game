Mastermind is a board game for two players, I made it in C

Mastermind is a game where the object is to guess the order of four prearranged pegs that are generated randomly by the computer.  The four colours may be repeated and there may be blank spots in the pattern as well.  The colours are drawn from the rainbow -Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.The player has to guess the order of the pegs.  Only a winning guess will be confirmed by the program.  In all other cases a combination of black and white pegs will be used to give feedback in the following way:a white peg indicates a correct colour in the wrong positiona black peg indicates a correct colour in the correct positionSoif the user guesses all of the colours correctly, but has no peg correctly placed,then the feedback is four white pegs.  If no colours are correct, then no pegs are awarded for that guess.The player should be able to choose between Easy –4 colours with no repeats or blank spacesMedium –4 colours with repeats, but no blank spacesHard levels –4 colours with repeats and blanks spaces as optionsThe player should also be able to configure the number of guesses available up to a max of 15.
